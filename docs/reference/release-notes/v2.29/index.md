## Improvements to our CLI

In [v2.27](../v.27/index.md#create-gatsby) we introduced `create-gatsby`, a new and interactive way to create a Gatsby site. You can run it in your terminal with `npm init gatsby`.

A couple of papercuts were fixed but we also added new features:

- Prompt for your site name instead of a folder name
- Automatically add this name to your `siteMetadata` and `package.json`
- Add `-y` flag. This flag bypasses all prompts other than namin your site

The regular `gatsby-cli` received a new command to list out all plugins in your site by running `gatsby plugin ls`.

## Performance improvements

We were able to ship a bunch of performance improvements both to Gatsby itself and its plugins:

- The PR [#28375](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/28375) fixed an unguided search in `gatsby-source-contentful` that can significantly drop your time for an incremental build (and perhaps others). In this case (for a site with 80k elements) it dropped the time from 5 minutes to sub-second.
- The PR [#28438](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/28438) prevents some redudant calculations resulting in 5% improvements for bigger sites
- The PR [#28525](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/28525) drops the `async` keyword from the `wrappingResolver` that wraps all resolvers passed on to GraphQL. In practice this means a 5-10% overall improvement to the runtime of a site.

## Slugify option for File System Route API

The File System Route API uses [slugify](https://github.com/sindresorhus/slugify) to create slugs for the generated routes. You're now able to pass custom options to that instance, e.g. when you want to change the separator. The full details are listed in the [README](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-page-creator) of `gatsby-plugin-page-creator`.

## gatsby-image codemod

If you want to try out the new `gatsby-plugin-image` that we introduced in [v2.26](../v2.26/index.md#gatsby-plugin-image010-beta) you now can run it: #TODO

## Notable bugfixes

- Scroll restoration issue in the browser API was fixed in [#27384](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/27384) that affected e.g. page transitions
- Do not fail in develop when eslint loader is removed in [#28494](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/28494)
- Respect hash as source of truth for scroll position in [#28555](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/28555)
